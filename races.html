                                A tribe of technologists. Making up 10% of the Spiran population. They have a unique
                                language and,
                                unlike other races in Spira, they use machina. Spira's main religion, Yevon, see the
                                Al Bhed as
                                heretics and they are widely ostracized. Many Al Bhed likewise, oppose the
                                pilgrimage tradition the
                                Yevon temples uphold as core dogma.
                                The Al Bhed have blond hair and green eyes with spiral-shaped pupils. They dress in
                                distinctive
                                colorful bodysuits and commonly wear goggles and masks. Despite being a marginalized
                                group, the Al
                                Bhed have a team in the blitzball league and excel at the sport.
                                Around 1000 years ago, the Al Bhed society lived on Bikanel Island, whose most
                                explored region is
                                known as the Sanubia Desert. Sin destroyed their city, and the citizens scattered
                                around Spira,
                                often detested by the other races of the world.
                                Cid, Rikku's father and Yuna's uncle, resettled the Al Bhed on Bikanel Island and
                                built a new city
                                called Home.

                                is Guadosalam, from witin they guard the entrance to the Farplane. Due to their

                                and protecting the Farplane in Guadosalam, they are astute in determining unsent

                                Their high speed makes the Guado Glories and effective blitzball team.
                                Unlike other races in Spira, Guado do not seem to leave behind bodies when dead,
                                in the case of

                                guardians of the Farplane have led to them looking down upon other races. The
                                Guado were converted
                                to the Yevon religion under their leader, Jyscal Guado, who was later appointed
                                a Maester of Yevon.
                                Despite their strict religious culture, they are generous and welcoming to

                                The Ronso is a race of muscular, anthropomorphic feline humanoids from the
                                world of Spira. They
                                stand above two meters in height, the males are considerably larger and more
                                muscular then the
                                females. They have hands with claws and paws for feet. They are covered in
                                blue fur with patches of
                                white with fangs, a cats nose, golden eyes and a tail. They tie back their
                                main in braids and
                                ponytails. They are formidable warriors, known for their strong sense of
                                honor and loyalty, as well
                                as their pride and quickness to anger.
                                The Ronso live at the base of Mt. Gagazet and guard the sacred mountain.
                                Hardly anything is known
                                about their culture, other than that they view the mountain a sacred
                                location and trekking up
                                Gagazet is viewed as a spiritual journey for a Ronso seeking guidance. The
                                Ronso take pride in
                                protecting the mountain and compete with each other to chose who is worthy
                                of being guardian of the
                                sacred mountain.

                                Kelk Ronso is the tribe leader and their representative in Bevelle as a
                                Maester of Yevon.

                                The Ronso have a blitzball team called the Ronso Fangs.

                            <h3>Fayths & Aeons</h3>
                            <br />
                            <img src="./img/Aeons.jpg" alt="Aeons" height="400" />
                            <p>
                                The Fayth are humans who willingly had their souls sealed in statues in
                                a state of dreaming in
                                Spira. A ritual that removes their souls from their still living bodies
                                are sealed into stone
                                tablets. This technique of creating Fayth's was used in Zanarkand. Their
                                powers allow a summoner to
                                coalesce the power of pyreflies to create physical forms of the Fayth's
                                dream, called Aeons, or
                                other magical phenomena.

                                Aeons are the physical realization of the Fayth's dreams. The fayth's
                                aeon form is the physical
                                embodiment of the fayth itself. Aeons usually embody the fayth's
                                strongest emotion, for example
                                Anima's pain and sorrow. The Fayth communicate with summoners who pray
                                to them within the Chambers
                                of the Fayth, and establish a mental link between the Fayth and the
                                summoner. Using this link, the
                                fayth gives their dream a physical form: an Aeon.

                                Aeons are powerful creatures only a summoner can use in battle. Most
                                aeons resemble their respective
                                fayth, so it can be assumes the aeon takes on aspects of the person
                                whose soul is sealed inside the
                                fayth statue. Many summoner can communicate with any one fayth to
                                establish a mental link with them,
                                enabling them to then summon the fayth's aeon, but only one summoner can
                                call on a particular
                                fayth's power at any one time. This is why during the aeon duels two of
                                the same aeon cannot battle
                                one another, Dark Aeons are an exception to this rule.

                                The Hypello have a speech impediment, often lisping any words with an 'S', for
                                example shay instead
                                of say and yesh in place for yes and some words are just gibberish as well as ending
                                most of their
                                sentences with a questioning tone. The Hypello are responsible for managing the
                                shoopuf service
                                across the Moonflow, which is their home.
                                Though the Hypello are excellent swimmers, they have no desire for competition,
                                there for they have
                                no blitzball team.

                                Daraya, Donga and Mouse - Pukara, Pukatak. The musician's existence coincides with

                                woods. They may have an affinity for music as the spirits met belong to Borra's
                                band. They have an
                                ear for prophecy as witnessed on their talks to Yuna about the fading woods and
                                mention of the state
                                of the Farplane. The Mouse musician always speaks in rhymes.

                                Due to the ban of machina, chocobo-powered machines were in wide demand until the
                                coming of the
                                Eternal Calm. Chocobos are most commonly seen on the Mi'ihen Highroad. Chocobos
                                demonstrate a skill
                                in jumping, allowing them to reach high ledges and combined leaping and flapping of
                                their wings to
                                gain extra height. Chocobos are also used as transportation, either being ridden
                                themselves or
                                pulling chariots. They are raced for fun in the Calm lands.
