                <h1>Locations</h1>
                <p>The world of Spira consists of islands floating around a massive continent that stretches to the
                    north and south. The world seems to be blessed with a warm, pleasant climate. Dream Zanarkand, a
                    realm introduced at the start of the story, cannot be visited by living beings.</p>

                <li>Dream Zanarkand
                    <br />
                    The mechanical metropolis in which Tidus grew up. This city is actually a dream summoned by Yu
                    Yevon, who sought to reproduce Zanarkand and its people as they existed a thousand years ago.
                    In early development the city was called Registan.
                </li>
                <li>Submerged Ruins - Temple of Yevon-Baaj
                    <br />
                    The ruins of a Yevon temple destroyed by Sin decades earlier, Seymour lived here as a youth in the
                    care of his mother, and in this temple's Chamber of the Fayth the youth Guado installed a statue
                    representing Anima's Fayth.

                </li>
                <li>Salvage Ship
                    <br />
                    A ship that belongs to the Al Bhed. It is used to go diving in ruins for machina. Brother is the
                    leader of the ship. You visit this ship just once in the game, and you go on a salvage hunt with
                    Rikku and her crew.
                </li>
                <li>Besaid Island
                    <br />
                    An island on the southern tip of Spira. It is a place abundant with nature. Its mountain regions are
                    overgrown and with thick vegetation, broken up by a number of free-flowing waterfalls. Yuna and
                    Wakka grew up in the elevated settlement of Besaid Island.
                </li>
                <li>S.S. Liki
                    <br />
                    The ship that ferries people between the islands of Besaid and Kilika. It is powered by chocobos and
                    sails.
                </li>
                <li>Kilika Island
                    <br />
                    An island to the northwest of Besaid Island. Its residents reside in Kilika Port, a community built
                    in the shallows. Lying just beyond the forest, Kilika Temple is well known as a spot where players
                    can pray for a victory in blitzball.
                </li>
                <li>S.S. Winno
                    <br />
                    The ship that ferries people between the island of Kilika and the city of Luca. This is where you
                    perform the Jecht Shot for the first time. There is also a mini game that unlocks after you complete
                    the Cloister of Trials at the Djose Temple. Return there and talk the woman at the top of the
                    stairs, she will ask you how many seagulls are flying around. Tell her there are 11 total and she
                    will gift you with the Ace Wizard weapon.
                </li>
                <li>Luca
                    <br />
                    The second largest city in Spira, it is famed for its massive blitzball stadium and a theater that
                    plays movies and music. Luca has its own unique character, and teams of all races and cultures come
                    to participate in its blitzball tournaments.
                </li>
                <li>Mi'ihen Highroad
                    <br />
                    A highway famously walked by the hero Mi'ihen eight hundred years in the past. The Hero was the
                    founder of the Crusaders and he has a statue on the Highroad. Part of the road was destroyed by Sin
                    five hundred years ago, but a new road was built in its place. Along this highway, travelers can
                    rent chocobos and find lodging at the Agency.
                </li>
                <li>Mushroom Rock Road
                    <br />
                    A highway connected to the northern tip of the Mi'ihen Highroad. The surrounding rockface resembles
                    a pile of mushrooms; hence the name. The highway eventually forks, with one path leading to the
                    highlands and the other to the Djose Highroad.
                </li>
                <li>Djose
                    <br />
                    A region located to the south of central Spira. The Djose Highroad is know for the wind-eroded
                    cliffs running through the coastlines. Many people visit the Djose Temple while traveling the
                    highway, praying for a safe return.
                </li>
                <li>Moonflow
                    <br />
                    A large river that crosses the continent from north to south, filled with sunken ruins from a
                    vanished era of technological civilization. When the purple moonlilies along the riverbank are in
                    full bloom, they attract countless pyreflies during the night hours. The Hypello people ride
                    domestic creatures known as shoopufs, ferrying passengers from one side of the river to the other.
                </li>
                <li>Guadosalam
                    <br />
                    The city of the demihuman Guado people. Seymour's mansion is here, as is a mystical area replete
                    with pyreflies that is known as the Farplane. Specters of the deceased appear in the Farplane when
                    summoned by the living, resulting in many visitors who come to reunite with their loved ones.

                </li>
                <li>Thunder Plains
                    <br />
                    A dangerous wasteland where rain and lightning are constantly released from the dark clouds that
                    blanket the sky. In the past, travelers often lost their lives to lightning strikes while crossing
                    the Thunder Plains, until an Al Bhed named Bilghen installed lightning rods that greatly increased
                    the odds of safe passage.
                </li>
                <li>Macalania
                    <br />
                    A shimmering forest can be found in the region, as well as a lake frozen over by the fayth in the
                    local temple. The Macalania Woods connect to Bevelle and the Calm Lands, and the spheres in the
                    middle of the forest gushes water dense with pyreflies, the raw material used in spheres.
                </li>
                <li>Bikanel Island
                    <br />
                    A large island to the west of the main continent, largely covered in desert. Due to a lack of
                    visitors, the Al Bhed that had been persecuted by the temples of Yevon were able to establish the
                    city of Home in secret. One corner of the island is home to Cactuars.
                </li>
                <li>Home
                    <br />
                    It is the home of the Al Bhed clan located on Bikanel Island. It is an underground fortress hidden
                    amid the Bikanel desert. It was built under Cid's direction to be the home of the Al Bhed, whom a
                    lot fo the rest of Spira despise for not following the teachings of Yevon. This is where the Al Bhed
                    house the kidnapped summoners they hold to save them from their fate.
                </li>
                <li>Bevelle
                    <br />
                    The largest city in all of Spira, Bevelle is the cradle of Yevon's teachings, and the head temple of
                    Yevon sits proudly in the middle of the city. The city's defenses are strict. No on can enter
                    without passing over the Highbridge.
                </li>
                <li>Calm Lands
                    <br />
                    The plain where high summoners across multiple generations challenged Sin in order to bring about
                    the temporary peace of Calm. To the east is a monster training facility for Crusaders established by
                    the hero Mi'ihen, while the north lies the Cavern of the Stolen Fayth.
                </li>
                <li>Mt. Gagazet
                    <br />
                    A sacred mountain in the north of Spira, protected by the Ronso tribe. Harsh blizzards sweep the
                    snowy mountain trial, sapping the strength of anyone brave enough to walk its path. Figures of the
                    fayth, used to summon Dream Zanarkand, line the summit cliffs.
                </li>
                <li>Zanarkand Ruins
                    <br />
                    The relics of a city destroyed a thousand years ago, located in the northernmost tip of the
                    continent. The fayth of the Final Summoning rests here, offering the ability to defeat Sin. Hopeful
                    summoners treat the ruins as their final destination on their pilgrimage.
                </li>
                <li>Inside Sin
                    <br />
                    A mysterious space overflowing with pyreflies that unfolds within Sin's massive body. The existence
                    of realms resembling Dream Zanarkand and a blitzball stadium are reflections of Jecht's memories
                    influencing Sin.
                </li>
                <li>Omega Ruins
                    <br />
                    An optional dungeon located within a small group of islands to the east of Spira's main continent.
                    You can access this area through the monster arena. Rather maze-like, like inside Sin, this place
                    must be mapped by the player. Navigating the dark passages you encounter Master Tonberry and Great
                    Malboro, some of the toughest fiends in Spira. You face off two bosses at the end, Omega and Ultima.
