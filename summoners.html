                <h1>Summoners</h1>
                <p>Those who summon Aeons</p>
                <li>Yu Yevon
                    <br />
                    The leader of ancient Zanarkand. He is lady Yunalesca's father and the creator of Sin. One thousand
                    years ago Zanarkand and Bevelle were at war. Although Zanarkand had powerful summoners, Bevelle had
                    a strong military power that used mechanical technology to build weapons making them superior in
                    battle. In an attempt to save his people from Zanarkands inevitable demise, he creates dream-like
                    memory and his people are put into a slumber within this dream. After this is set in motion, he is
                    incapable to stopping what he is doing and creates Sin to protect his Dream Zanarkand. Sin's
                    ultimate goal is to destroy all machina and all large settlements to stall technological evolution,
                    to avoid its demise once more.
                </li>
                <li>Lady Yunalesca
                    <br />
                    A legendary heroine who devised the Final Summoning thousands of years prior to the events of the
                    story. In the present era, she resides in Zanarkand as an unsent. As the daughter of the ancient
                    summoner Yevon, Yunalesca learns that Sin cannot be destroyed as long as her father Yu Yevon's shade
                    remains as its core. Using this knowledge, she bestows the Final Summoning upon worthy summoners.
                </li>
                <li>Lenne
                    <br />
                    Summoner who lived back in the time of the ancient war before Sin was created. She was a pop-star
                    summoner that was drafted in the war, her lover Shuyin infiltrated Bevelle to end the war with their
                    doomsday weapon in an attempt to save her. Lenne followed him and died trying to stop him. They were
                    caught by Bevelle's security forces and they unleashed a barrage of bullets upon them.
                </li>
                <li>Gandof
                    <br />
                    Spira's first high summoner, he defeated Sin through the Final Summoning four hundred years ago.
                    Famed for sealing the evil Qactuars in stones across the Thunder Plains.
                </li>
                <li>Ohalland
                    <br />
                    A high summoner from Kilika Island who defeated Sin 230 years ago. A vaunted blitzball player who
                    took on a godlike status within the sport.
                </li>
                <li>Yocun
                    <br />
                    A high summoner who defeated Sin one hundred years ago and brought about a Calm. Originally a member
                    of the Crusaders, she trained continuously in the valley of the Calm Lands.

                </li>
                <li>Lord Braska
                    <br />
                    Yuna's late father and the fourth high summoner of Spira. A former priest who became a summoner
                    after Sin killed his wife, an Al Bhed. Ten years before the events of the story, Braska embarked on
                    a pilgrimage with Jecht and Auron to defeat that generation's Sin through the Final Summoning. He
                    lost his life in the process, leaving deep scars on the daughter he left behind.
                </li>
                <li>Yuna
                    <br />
                    A summoner who is following in the footsteps of her father, the late high summoner Braska. At 17
                    years old, she embarks on her pilgrimage to obtain the Final Summoning to defeat Sin. On her
                    journey, she finds out the tradition of the pilgrimage is a scam and the Final Summoning does not
                    stop Sin, it just resets the cycle, so she strays from the teachings of Yevon to find her own way to
                    beat Sin. She is branded a traitor to Yevon but still continues her journey and defeats Sin for good
                    at the end.
                </li>
                <li>Seymour
                    <br />
                    A capable individual who became a maester of Yevon's teachings at a young age, Seymour faced
                    persecution all his life due to his mixed heritage as the child of a human mother and a Guado
                    chieftain. This caused him to hate Spira and its people. Before the start of the story, he secretly
                    murders his father Jyscal, succeeding him as a maester of Yevon and the leader of the Guado. Well
                    aware that the Final Aeon must become the next Sin, he wants to exploit Yuna to become Sin itself so
                    he can destroy Spira.
                </li>
                <li>Isaaru
                    <br />
                    A serious and well-mannered summoner with a cool appearance. He idolized Braska from a young age and
                    is friendly towards his daughter Yuna. Nevertheless, he is forced to fight he on the order of the
                    temples.
                </li>
                <li>Dona
                    <br />
                    A sexy summoner who views Yuna as her rival. She is proud of the bond between her and Barthello, her
                    lover and guardian. Though she lacks honesty and affects an air of self-importance, Dona is actually
                    a sweet girl at her core.
                </li>
                <li>Belgemine
                    <br />
                    A wandering summoner. Having been a summoner far longer than Yuna, she challenges her to multiple
                    battles across the land to better train her aeons. In truth she is an unsent who remains on Spira to
                    train up-and-coming summoners.
                </li>
                <li>Ginnem
                    <br />
                    The first summoner to take on Lulu as a guardian. Two years ago she set out on a pilgrimage for the
                    Final Summoning but use dup all her strength communing with the fayth of the aeon Yojimbo. She
                    remains on Spira as an unsent, dwelling in the cavern of that fayth, in the Calm Lands.
                </li>
                <li>Zuke
                    <br />
                    The second summoner who accepted Lulu as his guardian. He failed in his pilgrimage half a year ago
                    in the Calm Lands. He wishes only for Lulu's happiness and risks warning her when her party is
                    pursued by Yevon.
                </li>
                <li>O'aka's little sister
                    <br />
