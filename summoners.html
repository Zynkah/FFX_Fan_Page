                                A capable individual who became a maester of Yevon's teachings at a young age, Seymour
                                faced
                                persecution all his life due to his mixed heritage as the child of a human mother and a
                                Guado
                                chieftain. This caused him to hate Spira and its people. Before the start of the story,
                                he secretly
                                murders his father Jyscal, succeeding him as a maester of Yevon and the leader of the
                                Guado. Well
                                aware that the Final Aeon must become the next Sin, he wants to exploit Yuna to become
                                Sin itself so
                                he can destroy Spira.

                                is friendly towards his daughter Yuna. Nevertheless, he is forced to fight he on the

                                temples.

                                A sexy summoner who views Yuna as her rival. She is proud of the bond between her and
                                Barthello, her
                                lover and guardian. Though she lacks honesty and affects an air of self-importance, Dona
                                is actually
                                a sweet girl at her core.

                                battles across the land to better train her aeons. In truth she is an unsent who remains
                                on Spira to
                                train up-and-coming summoners.
