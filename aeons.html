                            <h3>Valefor</h3>

                                An aeon with great wings whose fayth statue is located in Besaid Temple.
                                This aerial aeon easily dodges many attacks from the ground. Valefor's regular attack is
                                a quick,
                                snatching motion, which is enhanced by the aeon's high accuracy. The unique attack is
                                song wings,
                                and attack that sends a shockwave at one enemy, inflicting damage and delaying the
                                enemy's next
                                turn. Because of the delay effect and short recovery time, you can often hit enemies
                                repeatedly with
                                sonic wings. The Overdrive attack is Energy Ray which fires a super-charged beam that
                                explodes
                                underneath all the foes and causes non-elemental damage. There is a second secret
                                overdrive for
                                Valefor as well. You obtain this all you have to do is return to Besaid and speak to a
                                little girl
                                with a dog standing next to the temple. You will receive an item that gives Valefor the
                                Overdrive
                                energy blast. If the little girl is not in by the temple then look for her in the item
                                shop. Energy
                                blast inflicts greater damage at the cost of higher recovery time. Once Yuna activates
                                her ultimate
                                weapon, Nirvana, all of Valefor's attacks can break the 9999 damage limit.

                                A demon that holds dominion over fire, with a fayth statue situated in Kilika Temple.
                                According to
                                the writing on its statue illustration, Ifrit's fayth was a twenty-three year old boy
                                named
                                Edmondo.
                                Ifrit has incredibly high strength in exchange for low defense and magic defense. He can
                                self heal
                                by casting fire upon himself. His unique attack is meteor strike, a non-elemental attack
                                that is
                                hurled at one enemy, but has a longer recovery time that his regular attack. This is a
                                useful
                                long-range attack. It also penetrates protect spells despite being a physical attack.
                                Ifrit's
                                Overdrive is Hellfire, this attack encases its foes in a swirling ball of fiery
                                vengeance
                                and
                                detonates it for massive damage to all enemies. All of Ifrit's attacks can reach the
                                9999
                                damage

                                lightning, an affinity represented by the electric motif of is magic circle.
                                Ixion's high defense and magic defense attributes make it a good aeon to summon when the
                                party needs
                                protections from an attack. Ixion's unique attack is Aerospark, where he fires spinning,

                                Lightning based elemental damage is inflicted against all enemies. Ixion can inflict

                                The queen of ice is a gorgeous sight to behold and an agile attacker. Her unique attack

                                Strike, creating a giant block of ice and drops it on an enemy. The attack slightly

                                Her overdrive is Diamond Dust, freezing all enemies in layers of ice, and then destroys
                                everything
                                with a leisurely snap of her fingers. All of Shiva's attack can inflict more than 9999

                                Bahamut possesses the auto-ability Break Damage Barrier. This enables its attacks to

                                regular attack causes more damage than any other aeon's. Bahamut can also cast the

                                hurls them, damaging all enemies. Impulse is especially useful when fighting multiple
                                opponents. His
                                overdrive is Mega Flare, a classic attack for this character. Bahamut anchors itself and
                                fires a
                                destructive breath attack that annihilates anything in its path. Bahamut's overdrive
                                consistently
                                deals over 9999 HP damage to all enemies, and it will continue to grow stronger.

                                A master swordsman whose fayth statue is situated in the Cavern of the Stolen Fayth. The
                                blade is
                                his left hand, Zanmato, can only be seen in the rare instance that he uses the attack of
                                the
                                same
                                name.
                                Yojimbo is the secret aeon you can acquire by visiting the Cavern of the Stolen Fayth
                                beneath the
                                bridge at the northeast end of the Calm Lands. To acquire Yojimbo, fight through the
                                cave
                                and defeat
                                Yojimbo in battle. Proceed to the Chamber of the Fayth and speak to Yojimbo to negotiate
                                a
                                fee for
                                his services. He will offer his lowest initial asking price if you choose the option "To
                                defeat the
                                most powerful of enemies".
                                For your first bid, offer half of his asking price plus 1 gil. So, if he asks for
                                250,000
                                offer
                                125,001 gil. After his next offer, raise your bid by 1 gil. By the time her proposes
                                205,000, he
                                will generally accept offers below 200,000, though not much lower. If at any point you
                                offer
                                him at
                                least triple his asking price, he will give you two teleport spheres in addition to his
                                services.
                                Yojimbo has four unique attacks; Daigoro, Kozuka, Wakizashji, and Zanmato yet has not
                                selectable
                                overdrive attacks. As a sword-for-hire, he will attack enemies based on how much you pay
                                him.
                                Yojimbo's attacks exceed 9999 HP damage once you activated Auron's Masamune.

                                An aeon bound in heavy chains whose fayth statue can be found in the temple of
                                Yevon-Baaj.
                                Its fayth
                                is Seymour's mother, and the plate around its neck is engraved with her image.
                                Anima is first seen as Seymour's chilling aeon, but the party can acquire it by
                                undertaking
                                a quest.
                                Return to Baaj Temple from the airship, defeating Geosgaeno, and then enter the
                                underwater
                                temple.
                                Find the six hidden items in the Cloister of Trials at each temple, and then approach
                                each
                                statue
                                inside Anima's shrine. This opens a doorway to the most devastating aeon in the game.
                                Anima's unique
                                attack, Pain, conjures the essence of misery and anguish, and unleashes it upon a single
                                enemy. The
                                attack has a high chance of causing instant death. Pain has a high recovery time. Her
                                overdrive is
                                Oblivion, the most horrifying overdrive that inflicts multiple non-elemental attacks on
                                all
                                enemies.

                                Three sister aeons whose fayth statue is situated in Remiem Temple. Each sister has a

                                insect motif -- a ladybug for Cindy, the eldest; a mantis for the middle child, Sandy;
                                and a
                                hornet
                                for Mindy, the youngest. Each of their magic circles reflects those characteristics.
                                This trio made a previous appearance in FF4. They can be yours to summon by undertaking
                                a
                                side
                                quest. Capture all of the enemies in the Mt. Gagazet area, and return to the monster
                                arena
                                to get
                                the Blossom Crown. Acquire all the other aeons, including Yojimbo and Anima, and return
                                to
                                Remiem
                                Temple in the Calm Lands. Challenge and defeat Belgemine's versions of your aeons. After
                                defeating
                                her version of Bahamut, she will give you the Flower Scepter. Continue to defeat Yojimbo
                                and
                                Anima.
                                Then move to the door in the back and unseal it with these two key items. The Magus
                                Sisters
                                are like
                                three separate aeons. As such, they are a bit difficult to control. There are verbal
                                requests that
                                must be made, and whether or not they grant Yuna's wishes depends upon their level of
                                morale. These
                                sisters have 3 unique attacks; Camisade, Razzia and Passado. The sisters might perform
                                their
                                unique
                                attacks randomly when the "Do what you will" choice is selected, or they might do it
                                when
                                Yuna
                                shouts "Go! Go!". Cindy's Camisade shoots blades of fire at an enemy, while Sandy's
                                Razzia
                                launches
                                her onto her target. Little Mindy's Passado will rapidly fire a burst of fifteen
                                stingers at
                                a
                                single enemy. Their overdrive is Delta Attack. When the Magus Sisters are all in
                                Overdrive
                                mode at
                                the same time, a new command, "Combine Powers!" appears. The sisters will join forces
                                and
                                perform
                                one of the most devastating overdrives in the entire game.
