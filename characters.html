                                The optimistic crybaby who gives hope to a world gripped in the spiral of death.

                                A popular blitzball player from the metropolis of Zanarkand. The son of Jecht, a
                                blitzball legend,
                                Tidus rebelled against his father from an early age. During a match, Tidus is attacked
                                by the
                                monstrous fiend known as Sin. Thrown into the unfamiliar world of Spira, he joins the
                                summoner Yuna
                                on her journey.

                                Tidas is a cheerful young teenager, the star blitzball player of the Zanarkand Abes.
                                He has long resented his father, a renowned blitzball player who disappeared during
                                Tidus's youth.
                                Shortly after his father's disappearance, Tidus's mother died of heart break, she deeply
                                loved Jecht
                                and just completely gave up on everything after he was gone, even neglecting her own
                                son. This made
                                Tidus hate his father even more, blaming him for his mothers death. Auron was Tiuds's
                                guardian after
                                this, watching him from afar.
                                Tidus's quick moves allow him to attack even the swiftest of foes with ease.

                                The summoner possessing endless kindness, willing to sacrifice herself to save the
                                world.

                                Daughter of High Summoner Braska. When her father left for his pilgrimage she was left
                                behind in the
                                city she was born, Bevelle. After her father's success she first felt great pride, but
                                then realized
                                he would never return, sacrificing his own life to bring on the temporary calm. She was
                                only 7 years
                                old when all this happened. Shortly after a young Ronso named Kimahri came to become her
                                guardian
                                and brought her to a small village called Besaid. There she met Wakka and Lulu, who
                                looked after her
                                as their own little sister. When she turned 17 she decided to follow in her father's
                                footsteps and
                                entered the temple in Besaid to gain her first aeon, Valefor.

                                A summoner who is following in the footsteps of her father, the revered high summoner
                                Braska. Yuna's
                                tender nature balances her fierce resolve. Like her father before her, Yuna seeks the
                                power of the
                                final summoning to defeat Sin. At first Yuna is ready to trade her life to bring about a
                                temporary
                                calm, but her pilgrimage leads her to discover how the teachings of Yevon deceive those
                                they are
                                meant to guide, as well as the true nature of the Final Summoning. Armed with this
                                information, she
                                resolves to live and reject the endless spiral of death.

                                Yuna is the daughter of the high summoner who defeated Sin to bring about the "Calm", a
                                time of
                                peace.
                                Yuna embarks on a pilgrimage to obtain the final aeon and defeat Sin.
                                To complete her quest, Yuna has enlisted the aid of her most trusted friends as her
                                guardians.

                                The legendary guardian who guides a young man to fulfill a promise to a friend.

                                A man tasked with watching over Tidus in Dream Zanarkand who created the opportunity for
                                Tidus to
                                venture to Spira. Auron is know as the "legendary guardian", having guarded the high
                                summoner Braska
                                ten years ago when he defeated Sin. Despite his service on that pilgrimage, Auron could
                                not prevent
                                the tragedy that befell Braska and Jecht. He also lost his own life, becoming an
                                "unsent" who
                                lingered in the world of the living. Auron joins Yuna's party as one of her guardians,
                                wagering on
                                the possibility that the children of his old friends might discover the truth and tell
                                their own
                                story.

                                The legendary guardian who accompanied High Summoner Braska on the pilgrimage to defeat
                                Sin ten
                                years ago.
                                Auron guides Yuna and Tidus on their mission to vanquish Sin once more.
                                He swings his gigantic sword with such power that even the toughest fiends are cut
                                asunder.

                                The hornless Ronso youth dedicating his life to Yuna.

                                A Ronso who serves as Yuna's first guardian. His taciturn nature and leonine appearance
                                makes him
                                hard to approach, but in truth Kimahri is thoughtful and affectionate. After the death
                                of the high
                                summoner Braska, he brought the young Yuna to Besaid Village and watched over her for
                                the next ten
                                years. His horn, the pride of a Ronso, was broken by his rival Biran and the resulting
                                shame forced
                                Kimahri to flee his hometown of Gagazet. Despite this, he overcomes his trauma to
                                protect Yuna on
                                her pilgrimage.

                                A young warrior of the Ronso tribe, Kimahri watched over Yuna during her early years.
                                He is devoted to Yuna and serves her loyally as a guardian.
                                Kimahri can learn the special attacks of enemies with his Lancet ability.

                                A good-natured older-brother type who has dedicated his youth to blitzball.

                                The young coach and most valuable player of Besaid Village's blitzball team, the Besaid
                                Aurochs.
                                Tidus reminds Wakka of his late brother Chappu, and Wakka invites him to join the team.
                                Wakka has
                                looked after Yuna since she was seven years old. Once she becomes a summoner, he joins
                                her
                                pilgrimage as on of her guardians. Wakka is a devout follower of the teachings of Yevon,
                                and he
                                particularly hates the Al Bhed for opposing those teachings. But he changes his
                                prejudices after
                                learning more about them and about the truth behind Yevon's teachings.

                                Although he's the captain of the Besaid Aurochs blitzball team, Wakka plans to retire
                                from the sport
                                after this year's tournament so that he can devote himself entirely as Yuna's guardian.
                                His deadly blitzball is especially useful for shooting down aerial enemies.

                                The severe yet sweet Black Mage who aids her comrades with a wealth of knowledge.

                                A female Black Mage acting as Yuna's guardian who watches over her like a big sister.
                                She and Wakka
                                are childhood friends, and she was once engaged to marry Wakka's brother, Chappu. Lulu
                                has acted as
                                a summoner's guardian twice before, giving her extensive knowledge of the pilgrimage
                                experience. But
                                each prior pilgrimage ended in failure and the death of the summoner, leaving deep scars
                                in Lulu's
                                heart. Though she is harsh on herself and others, Lulu is kind at heart and hides a
                                secret weakness.
                                She even has a cute side, using her collection of stuffed animals as weapons.

                                Lulu's experience and wisdom are valuable assets to the party.
                                She treats Yuna as though she were her younger sister.
                                Although she may seem insensitive at times, there are depths to her emotions that only
                                her closest
                                friends can understand.

                            <h3>Rikku</h3>
                            <br />

                            <p>
                                A hearty and hard-working Al Bhed lass, constantly thinking about what she can
                                accomplish.

                                Daughter to the chief of the Al Bhed, a tribe of people persecuted for opposing the
                                teachings of
                                Yevon, Rikku is also Yuna's cousin on her mother's side. Under her people's pretense of
                                protecting
                                summoners from killing themselves, Rikku unsuccessfully tries to kidnap Yuna. In time,
                                she comes to
                                respect Yuna's determination to complete the summoner's pilgrimage and joins her party
                                as a
                                guardian. She may seem to have a cheerful scatterbrained personality, but like the other
                                Al Bhed,
                                Rikku is rational and steadfast, determined to overcome any obstacle in her way.

                                Rikku is a young Al Bhed girl with an upbeat and positive personality.
                                She dismantles mechanical enemies with ease, and can steal items from enemies as well.
                                When Rikku joins the party near the Moonflow, her technical expertise allows you to
                                start
                                customizing equipment by adding abilities to the open slots on weapons and armor.
